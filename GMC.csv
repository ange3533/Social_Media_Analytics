https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9zmLoyzh14,47058867900,mamilli215,Made it to Canada. But can’t make it to all 50 states first… #foreverwaiting
https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9zmLoyzh15,269150642,dhbucsfan,"@mamilli215 Canada is soon going to have a very poorly thought out and completely impractical Federal government mandate requiring all new vehicles sold in Canada to be electric within the next 7 yrs. It’s completely ridiculous, especially given the climate here, and the geographical size of the country but we’re led by a moronic wannabe-tyrant who’s personally heavily invested in the big green scam, so all the EV producers are trying to get an early foothold here in Canada ???????"
https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9zmLoyzh16,47058867900,mamilli215,"@dhbucsfan I feel your pain my neighbor to the north. That being said, still wish my R1S preorder from 2019 would magically show up!"
https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9zmLoyzh17,269150642,dhbucsfan,"@mamilli215 ?? I am definitely interested in one myself, which is why I follow this account, but starting @ $79K, without sufficient infrastructure in place, that’s a steep price to not be able to get to work when it snows ????"
https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9zmLoyzh18,251044301,nobadreply,"@dhbucsfan outch, this global EV push will bit many in the butt when the real truth about them comes out. I hate to use this as an indicator but E.Musk is not on the Fuel cell band wagon now, so that should speak volumes... That's said, like @mamilli215 stated, I pre-ordered a R1S back in end of 2018. When they broke news max pack won't ever make it to the R1S, I switched body to R1T. Well, because I want my quad motor, max pack on 22, I've been pushed back for a 3rd time to 2024. The messed up part is the motorized bed cover is no longer available due to, well, poor design and jamming. I wanted it to well, open it up and make an accessory to improve it and make better. I've since moved on and in process of purchasing a different pickup but still would like my R1T. Only because the market isn't saturated with them yet and it's not an everyday see. When it reaches that point, if if I haven't gotten it then, I'll cancel it as they are hoping many of the pre-order holders do or get a lesser config option at a higher cost/same cost of the pre-order config."
https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9zmLoyzh19,4209887289,sinewheel,@dhbucsfan maintain your current vehicle then. Mines 17 years and still going strong
https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9zmLoyzh20,269150642,dhbucsfan,"@nobadreply we already have supply and demand issues with our energy here, and there have been reports released by some of the top electrical infrastructure engineers in the province here that just three EV’s trying to charge at the same time on one street could overload the grid and cause a blackout for the entire block. Early government estimates at the cost of upgrading to “green” infrastructure at $99Billion, not including “other incidental costs” ????"
https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9zmLoyzh21,269150642,dhbucsfan,"@sinewheel I just bought a 2021 Canyon AT4 last year, I don’t really want an EV as the range is impractical for most of the work I do, but Trudope is doing a double fuel tax increase this year, adding another $.25/Litre in taxes to our gas, the current price of which already includes $.68/Litre in taxes depending on where you live ????????? Higher fuel costs also drive up the cost of all consumer goods as it costs more to get them to stores etc. and those increased costs won’t be absorbed but passed on to the end user of the goods. ??  So at some point switching to something like a Rivian will be the best short-term solution. But we’re just fighting the clock here, against a national leadership group who’s end goal is socialism, “you will own nothing and you will be happy” well you won’t be happy but voicing unhappiness will be banned and censored (Bill C11 is the first step on that path)"

Given how cold our climate is here, how practical is it to have vehicles that cannot be charged in the cold? Are you currently working on anything from the vehicle side for this, or is that all on the charging stations and energy providers? ??"
https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9zmLoyzh44,251044301,nobadreply,@dhbucsfan I've seen them as well but it's seem to be the newer charge stations that are having the problem during the extreme cold temps. The last one I saw was a guy driving around and testing the newer charge stations in his area that were working 100% before the freeze. This older chargers in same area worked without issues. I wonder if it was the same channel/video you saw. (Drawing a blank of the channels name)

https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9zmLoyzh91,251044301,nobadreply,"@cmarti38 kinda hard to read scarcasim. It's funny when people go to the far extreme to try a prove a point. What @ga_te_2_2 stated in general is factual. No manufacturing will ever openly talk about that. Thats one of the main reasons the US became a major importer vs exporter. All in the name of being able to claim it is greener than the others thus making us rely on other countries for goods. We were no longer fully self sustainable as a country. Now we're trying to undo all of that and it's not going well. I digress. So making a comment about stuff cell and devices in the garbage is a stretch. The batteries before lithium became main stream were just as good but heavy. Some batteries actually never needed replacing. I'd guess for every EV produced, that's probably equivalent to 700-1000 cell/laptop batteries. If I didn't have to us digital tech, I wouldn't but, I have to in today's time. We as a society openly accepted convince as a form of progress. So batteries are in everything now."
