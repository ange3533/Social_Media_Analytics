https://www.instagram.com/p/CapYi4NO093/,45335932579,jonathanmonjaras4,"Ford hasn't kept the upcoming F-150 Lightning a secret, evidenced by the company's million-pound towing stunt from 2019. The Lightning shares much of the regular F-150's body and cabin but swaps that truck's gasoline-powered V-6 and V-8 engine options for a pair of electric motors and one of two different battery packs. The Standard-Range battery is said to deliver up to 230 miles per charge and the Extended-Range juice pack is aiming for 300 miles. But by the time the 2022 F-150 Lightning reaches the market, it won't be the only all-electric pickup truck. GMC's Hummer EV SUT is close to its launch, and a rival truck from upstart Rivian may also beat Ford to the punch. Neither of those trucks, however, have the strength of the F-150 name behind them, and the electric version of America's favorite truck will surely be an impressive piece when it goes on sale sometime in spring 2022."

https://www.instagram.com/p/CapYi4NO093/,1467632814,haby_jorj,I recently bought a new Ford Escape hybrid 2021 fresh out of the showroom. Its been 7 minths since i bought the car and i have had 7 transmission issues already. The weird part is that the car electric system fixes itself the next day and when my car gets towed to the dealership the service employees cannot see any issues. I have been stuck with the car not moving at random places at gas stations and my apartment parking lot. The last time this happened was 3 days ago and i towed it to the dealership and apparently they cant even take my car 2 weeks out. Even worse they cant approve me a rental car stating that they cannot aprove it until they take a look at the car. Ford as a comany is taking its time for the buyback process too and i paid freaking 400 dollars for 3 days of rentals and other uber expenses when i got stuck at gas stations. This is still ongoing issue that i m dealing with.  Ford advertise reliability and is this how a customer is suffering just buying the car for 7 months have to deal with? Im writing this post so that no normal people have to go through this like me. This post is a hope that ford will realize how they are scamming people.  Ford Motor CompanyMagic City Ford Lincoln

Should have made the maverick all electric, not the lightning. The lightning should have been a supercharged 5.0, a muscle truck like the original. Also, @ford bring the Everest to the states. Make it actually off road capable like in Australia. Go after the Jeep grand cherokee and Toyota 4runner.  Put a true shifter in it, not a pathetic electric turn knob, front and rear lockers. Do not change the look of the everest if you bring it here.  Make 3rd row optional, not standard.  Put the 5.0, 2.7 eco, or even the 3.5 eco.  Make a FX4 edition or tremor, without the full sunroof.  I believe people here would like the everest and overlanders/off road enthusiasts that like the 4runner and jeeps would enjoy the vehicle.  Just a thought"

https://www.instagram.com/p/CapYi4NO093/,10573548425,unashamed_obs,"@peter_stranded but it... it kinda is though... all manufacturers are waiting for the superconductors that are made overseas. But ask yourself... why haven't they begun to make the superconductors themselves??? I mean, these companies have profit numbers up in the billions every year. That being the case, why can't they start making them? There's something going in behind the scenes here that the general public isn't being told."
https://www.instagram.com/p/CapYi4NO093/,33609845355,will.dornon,"@unashamed_obs it’s kinda hard to make chips, and takes a long time to build a chip factory. Ford is experienced with making cars, not computer chips."

https://www.instagram.com/p/CapYi4NO093/,48662087998,peter_stranded,Why
https://www.instagram.com/p/CapYi4NO093/,10573548425,unashamed_obs,"@will.dornon yes, but still, why hasn't anyone taken up this opportunity??? Why hasn't Hewlett-Packard (HP), or Lenovo, or LG, or any other manufacturer that makes computers, seized this opportunity to make a massive amount of profit in the current market? I'm telling you, whether we like it or not, they're INTENTIONALLY limiting the production of their vehicles at this point, which artificially drives up the demand for them, which also means they can sell them for two to three times what they're actually worth... hate to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but given the circumstances in this country right now, it's the most logical explanation I can come up with..."
https://www.instagram.com/p/CapYi4NO093/,10573548425,unashamed_obs,"@will.dornon plus, it means they can count out dealerships on part of the profit, eliminating the middle-man (at least partially) at the same time."
https://www.instagram.com/p/CapYi4NO093/,33609845355,will.dornon,"@unashamed_obs I don’t really know, they don’t really have an incentive to help automakers unless paid to do so, and the automakers I assume don’t want to do that because they know they will bounce right back."
https://www.instagram.com/p/CapYi4NO093/,10573548425,unashamed_obs,"@will.dornon I don't honestly know either man, but I will say that I hope I'm wrong on the situation. I hope there is a legitimate reason that things are being held up, and that it will be resolved in the near future, so that we can go back to the way things were. But unfortunately, I don't have a lot of faith in big companies and corporations these days, as they've proven time and time again that they're mostly just money hungry executives, and that they really don't care about their constituents."

https://www.instagram.com/p/CapYi4NO093/,410530165,alecmiller985,@jplatz76 I mean I live where it can get super cold… then tech with lithium batteries isn’t their yet. They can’t handle prolonged time in harsh weather conditions. Just like a power tool. I mean I could argue with anyone about electric cars but it’s pointless people think they are great and if that’s someone’s thing that’s fine. It’s just not my thing. We are years and years from it being more electric cars than gas on the road. And they aren’t even any better for the environment than a gas powered car… but people can just keep living in a fantasy world about them.  Not like any car companies have parts to make any cars right now anyway.  Electric or gas lol

So for the one my buddy ordered cost him $43,500 building and buying from fords website through a local dealer. But if that dealer built it themselves and had it sent to just sell to anyone it would be $63k. It’s disgusting to see these dealers doing that to people. And I quote from a salesmen I spoke with after test driving a four door big bend version bronco. “We aren’t dropping the price because some stupid sucker will come along and buy it and we will make an insanely huge profit off of one vehicle” I said well you haven’t found the sucker in me good luck screwing people over."
